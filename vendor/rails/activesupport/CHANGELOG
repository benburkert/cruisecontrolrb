* Fix remove_constant to correctly handle constant names of the form "::A::...". References #6720. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed Array#to_xml when it contains a series of hashes (each piece would get its own XML declaration) #6610 [thkarcher/cyu]

* Hash#to_xml handles keys with the same name as Kernel methods.  #6613 [Catfish]

* Don't quote hash keys in Hash#to_json if they're valid JavaScript identifiers.  Disable this with ActiveSupport::JSON.unquote_hash_key_identifiers = false if you need strict JSON compliance. [Sam Stephenson]

* Hash#to_xml supports Bignum and BigDecimal.  #6313 [edibiase]

* Don't undefine #class in OptionMerger [Rick]

* Hash.create_from_xml has been renamed to Hash.from_xml, alias will exist until Rails 2.0 [DHH]

* alias_method_chain works with accessor= methods also.  #6153 [Caio Chassot]

  <written-on type="date"></written-on> # => { :type => 'date' } # WRONG
  <written-on type="date"></written-on> # => nil # RIGHT

* Tighten rescue clauses.  #5985 [james@grayproductions.net]

* Inflections: don't singularize -ies plurals.  [foamdino@gmail.com, Mark Van Holstyn]

* Update Initializer to use load_once_paths to avoid plugin reloading. References #5852. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Use Array#assoc in ActiveSupport::OrderedHash. [Mauricio Fernandez]

* Greatly increased performance of String.to_json, which speeds up RJS considerably on large pages, fixes #3473 [Shugo Maeda]

* Detect missing_constants calls from removed modules and fail accordingly. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Stop using defined? in Dependencies.qualified_const_defined? since defined? may invoke const_missing. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Dependencies can autoload directories of nested classes. [Jeremy Kemper]
    Example:
      invoice.rb            class Invoice
      invoice/lineitem.rb   class Invoice::Lineitem

* Add Deprecation.silence so that Reloadable does not scold itself. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add debugging logging to Dependencies. Currently can be enabled with Dependencies.log_activity = true; adding to Initializer and documenting is forthcoming. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Replace Reloadable with improvements to the Dependencies mechanism. [Nicholas Seckar]

* DateTime#to_time gives hour/minute/second resolution.  #5747 [jon.evans@pobox.com]

* attr_internal to support namespacing and deprecation. Like attr_* except backed by internally-named instance variable. Set attr_internal_naming_format to change the format from the default '@_%s'. [Jeremy Kemper]
    # def foo()   @foo__rofl      end
    # def foo=(v) @foo__rofl = v  end
    self.attr_internal_naming_format = '@%s__rofl'
    attr_internal :foo

* Raise fully qualified names upon name errors. #5533 [lars@pinds.com, Nicholas Seckar]

* Add extention to obtain the missing constant from NameError instances. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Module#alias_attribute [Jamis/DHH]. Example:

    class Content < ActiveRecord::Base
      # has a title attribute
    end
 
    class Email < ActiveRecord::Base
      alias_attribute :subject, :title
    end
 
    e = Email.find(1)
    e.title    # => "Superstars"
    e.subject  # => "Superstars"
    e.subject? # => true
    e.subject = "Megastars"
    e.title    # => "Megastars"

* Deprecation: easier to work with warning behavior as procs; default behaviors for each environment so users needn't update env.rb; and testing pleasure with assert_deprecated, assert_not_deprecated. [Jeremy Kemper]
  By default, test prints to $stderr, dev logs, production ignores.
  Provide your own per-environment in e.g. config/environments/development.rb:
    ActiveSupport::Deprecation.behavior = Proc.new { |message| raise message }

* First cut of the Rails Deprecation system.   [Koz]

* Strip boolean XML content before checking for 'true' [Rick Olson]

* Customize default BigDecimal formatting. References #5672 [dave@pragprog.com]

* Correctly convert <foo nil="true"> to nil when using Hash.create_from_xml.  [Rick]

* Optional identity for Enumerable#sum defaults to zero. #5657 [gensym@mac.com]

* HashWithIndifferentAccess shouldn't confuse false and nil. #5601 [shugo@ruby-lang.org]

* Fixed HashWithIndifferentAccess#default #5586 [chris@seagul.co.uk]

* More compatible Hash.create_from_xml. #5523 [nunemaker@gmail.com]

* Added Enumerable#sum for calculating a sum from the elements [DHH, jonathan@daikini.com]. Examples:

    [1, 2, 3].sum
    payments.sum { |p| p.price * p.tax_rate }
    payments.sum(&:price)

  This is instead of payments.inject(0) { |sum, p| sum + p.price }

* Correct and clarify Array#to_sentence docs.  #5458 [brad@madriska.com]

* alias_method_chain preserves method punctuation so foo, foo?, and foo! may be chained with the same feature. [Jeremy Kemper]
    Example:
      alias_method_chain :save!, :validation
    is equivalent to
      alias_method :save_without_validation!, :save!
      alias_method :save!, :save_with_validation!

* Enhance Symbol#to_proc so it works with list objects, such as multi-dimensional arrays. Closes #5295 [nov@yo.rim.or.jp].  Example:

    {1 => "one", 2 => "two", 3 => "three"}.sort_by(&:first).map(&:last)
    #=> ["one", "two", "three"]

* Added Hash.create_from_xml(string) which will create a hash from a XML string and even typecast if possible [DHH]. Example:

    Hash.create_from_xml <<-EOT
      <note>
        <title>This is a note</title>
        <created-at type="date">2004-10-10</created-at>
      </note>
    EOT
  
  ...would return:
  
    { :note => { :title => "This is a note", :created_at => Date.new(2004, 10, 10) } }

* Added Jim Weirich's excellent FlexMock class to vendor (Copyright 2003, 2004 by Jim Weirich (jim@weriichhouse.org)) -- it's not automatically required, though, so require 'flexmock' is still necessary [DHH]

* Fixed that Module#alias_method_chain should work with both foo? foo! and foo at the same time #4954 [anna@wota.jp]

* to_xml fixes, features, and speedup: introduce :dasherize option that converts updated_at to updated-at if true (the existing default); binary columns get encoding="base64" attribute; nil values get nil="true" attribute to distinguish empty values; add type information for float columns; allow arbitrarily deep :include; include SQL type information as the type attribute.  #4989 [Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>]

* Add OrderedHash#values. [Sam Stephenson]

* Added Array#to_s(:db) that'll produce a comma-separated list of ids [DHH]. Example:
    
    Purchase.find(:all, :conditions => "product_id IN (#{shops.products.to_s(:db)})"

* Normalize classify's argument to a String so that it plays nice with Symbols. [Marcel Molina Jr.] 

* Strip out leading schema name in classify. References #5139. [schoenm@earthlink.net]

* Remove Enumerable#first_match since break(value) handles the use case well enough. [Nicholas Seckar]

  Enumerable#first_match was like detect, but instead of returning the matching element, the yielded value returned. For example:
  
    user_xml = adapters(:from => User, :to => Xml).first_match do |adapter|
      adapter.adapt @user
    end
  
  But this is just as easily done with:
  
    user_xml = adapters(:from => User, :to => Xml).each do
      break adapter.adapt(@user)
    end
  
* Make Array#in_groups_of just return the grouped collection if a block isn't given. [Marcel Molina Jr.] 

* Don't destroy a HashWithIndifferentAccess if symbolize_keys! or  stringify_keys! is called on it. Closes #5076. [Marcel Molina Jr., guy.naor@famundo.com]

* Document Module::delegate. #5002 [pergesu@gmail.com]

* Replace alias method chaining with Module#alias_method_chain. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Strip out punctuation on predicates or bang methods being aliased with alias_method_chain since target?_without_feature is not a valid method name. Add tests for Module#alias_method_chain. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Replace Ruby's deprecated append_features in favor of included. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Allow default options in with_options to be overridden. Closes #4480. [murphy@cYcnus.de] 

* Added Module#alias_method_chain [Jamis Buck]

* Updated to Builder 2.0 [DHH]

* Add Array#split for dividing arrays into one or more subarrays by value or block. [Sam Stephenson]


*1.3.1* (April 6th, 2006)

* Clean paths inside of exception messages and traces. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add Pathname.clean_within for cleaning all the paths inside of a string. [Nicholas Seckar]

*1.3.0* (March 27th, 2006)

* When possible, avoid incorrectly obtaining constants from parent modules. Fixes #4221. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add more tests for dependencies; refactor existing cases. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Move Module#parent and Module#as_load_path into core_ext. Add Module#parent. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add CachingTools::HashCaching to simplify the creation of nested, autofilling hashes. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Remove a hack intended to avoid unloading the same class twice, but which would not work anyways. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Update Object.subclasses_of to locate nested classes. This affects Object.remove_subclasses_of in that nested classes will now be unloaded. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Update Object.remove_subclasses_of to use Class.remove_class, reducing duplication. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Fixnum#seconds for consistency, so you can say 5.minutes + 30.seconds instead of 5.minutes + 30 #4389 [François Beausoleil]

* Added option to String#camelize to generate lower-cased camel case by passing in :lower, like "super_man".camelize(:lower) # => "superMan" [DHH]

* Added Hash#diff to show the difference between two hashes [Chris McGrath]

* Added Time#advance to do precise time time calculations for cases where a month being approximated to 30 days won't do #1860 [Rick Olson]

* Enhance Inflector.underscore to convert '-' into '_' (as the inverse of Inflector.dasherize) [Jamis Buck]

* Switched to_xml to use the xml schema format for datetimes.  This allows the encoding of time zones and should improve operability. [Koz]

* Added a note to the documentation for the Date related Numeric extensions to indicate that they're
approximations and shouldn't be used for critical calculations. [Koz]

* Added Hash#to_xml and Array#to_xml that makes it much easier to produce XML from basic structures [DHH]. Examples:

    { :name => "David", :street_name => "Paulina", :age => 26, :moved_on => Date.new(2005, 11, 15) }.to_xml
    
  ...returns:

      <person>
        <street-name>Paulina</street-name>
        <name>David</name>
        <age type="integer">26</age>
        <moved-on type="date">2005-11-15</moved-on>
      </person>

* Moved Jim Weirich's wonderful Builder from Action Pack to Active Support (it's simply too useful to be stuck in AP) [DHH]

* Fixed that Array#to_sentence will return "" on an empty array instead of ", and" #3842, #4031 [rubyonrails@beautifulpixel.com]

* Add Enumerable#group_by for grouping collections based on the result of some
  block. Useful, for example, for grouping records by date.

  ex.

     latest_transcripts.group_by(&:day).each do |day, transcripts| 
       p "#{day} -> #{transcripts.map(&:class) * ', '}"
     end
     "2006-03-01 -> Transcript"
     "2006-02-28 -> Transcript"
     "2006-02-27 -> Transcript, Transcript"
     "2006-02-26 -> Transcript, Transcript"

  Add Array#in_groups_of, for iterating over an array in groups of a certain
  size.

  ex.

     %w(1 2 3 4 5 6 7).in_groups_of(3) {|g| p g}
     ["1", "2", "3"]
     ["4", "5", "6"]
     ["7", nil, nil]

  [Marcel Molina Jr., Sam Stephenson]

* Added Kernel#daemonize to turn the current process into a daemon that can be killed with a TERM signal [DHH]

* Add 'around' methods to Logger,  to make it easy to log before and after messages for a given block as requested in #3809. [Michael Koziarski]  Example:

  logger.around_info("Start rendering component (#{options.inspect}): ", 
                     "\n\nEnd of component rendering") { yield }

* Added Time#beginning_of_quarter #3607 [cohen.jeff@gmail.com]

* Fix Object.subclasses_of to only return currently defined objects [Jonathan Viney <jonathan@bluewire.net.nz>]

* Fix constantize to properly handle names beginning with '::'. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Make String#last return the string instead of nil when it is shorter than the limit [Scott Barron].

* Added delegation support to Module that allows multiple delegations at once (unlike Forwardable in the stdlib) [DHH]. Example:

    class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_one :subscription
      delegate :free?, :paying?, :to => :subscription
      delegate :overdue?, :to => "subscription.last_payment"
    end
    
    account.free?    # => account.subscription.free?
    account.overdue? # => account.subscription.last_payment.overdue?

* Fix Reloadable to handle the case where a class that has been 'removed' has not yet been garbage collected. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Don't allow Reloadable to be included into Modules.

* Remove LoadingModule. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add documentation for Reloadable::Subclasses. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add Reloadable::Subclasses which handles the common case where a base class should not be reloaded, but its subclasses should be. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Further improvements to reloading code [Nicholas Seckar, Trevor Squires]
  
  - All classes/modules which include Reloadable can define reloadable? for fine grained control of reloading
  - Class.remove_class uses Module#parent to access the parent module
  - Class.remove_class expanded to handle multiple classes in a single call
  - LoadingModule.clear! has been removed as it is no longer required
  - Module#remove_classes_including has been removed in favor of Reloadable.reloadable_classes

* Added reusable reloading support through the inclusion of the Relodable module that all subclasses of ActiveRecord::Base, ActiveRecord::Observer, ActiveController::Base, and ActionMailer::Base automatically gets. This means that these classes will be reloaded by the dispatcher when Dependencies.mechanism = :load. You can make your own models reloadable easily:

    class Setting
      include Reloadable
    end
  
  Reloading a class is done by removing its constant which will cause it to be loaded again on the next reference. [DHH]

* Added auto-loading support for classes in modules, so Conductor::Migration will look for conductor/migration.rb and Conductor::Database::Settings will look for conductor/database/settings.rb [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add Object#instance_exec, like instance_eval but passes its arguments to the block.  (Active Support will not override the Ruby 1.9 implementation of this method.) [Sam Stephenson]

* Add Proc#bind(object) for changing a proc or block's self by returning a Method bound to the given object. Based on why the lucky stiff's "cloaker" method. [Sam Stephenson]

* Fix merge and dup for hashes with indifferent access #3404 [kenneth.miller@bitfield.net]

* Fix the requires in option_merger_test to unbreak AS tests. [Sam Stephenson]

* Make HashWithIndifferentAccess#update behave like Hash#update by returning the hash. #3419, #3425 [asnem@student.ethz.ch, JanPrill@blauton.de, Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Add ActiveSupport::JSON and Object#to_json for converting Ruby objects to JSON strings. [Sam Stephenson]

* Add Object#with_options for DRYing up multiple calls to methods having shared options. [Sam Stephenson]  Example:

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    # Account routes
    map.with_options(:controller => 'account') do |account|
      account.home   '',       :action => 'dashboard'
      account.signup 'signup', :action => 'new'
      account.logout 'logout', :action => 'logout'
    end
  end

* Introduce Dependencies.warnings_on_first_load setting.  If true, enables warnings on first load of a require_dependency.  Otherwise, loads without warnings.  Disabled (set to false) by default.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Active Support is warnings-safe.  #1792 [Eric Hodel]

* Introduce enable_warnings counterpart to silence_warnings.  Turn warnings on when loading a file for the first time if Dependencies.mechanism == :load.  Common mistakes such as redefined methods will print warnings to stderr.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Add Symbol#to_proc, which allows for, e.g. [:foo, :bar].map(&:to_s). [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Added the following methods [Marcel Molina Jr., Sam Stephenson]:
  * Object#copy_instance_variables_from(object) to copy instance variables from one object to another 
  * Object#extended_by to get an instance's included/extended modules
  * Object#extend_with_included_modules_from(object) to extend an instance with the modules from another instance

*1.2.5* (December 13th, 2005)

* Become part of Rails 1.0

* Rename Version constant to VERSION. #2802 [Marcel Molina Jr.]

*1.2.3* (November 7th, 2005)

* Change Inflector#constantize to use eval instead of const_get. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fix const_missing handler to ignore the trailing '.rb' on files when comparing paths. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Define kernel.rb methods in "class Object" instead of "module Kernel" to work around a Windows peculiarity [Sam Stephenson]

* Fix broken tests caused by incomplete loading of active support. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fix status pluralization bug so status_codes doesn't get pluralized as statuses_code.  #2758 [keithm@infused.org]

* Added Kernel#silence_stderr to silence stderr for the duration of the given block [Sam Stephenson]

* Changed Kernel#` to print a message to stderr (like Unix) instead of raising Errno::ENOENT on Win32 [Sam Stephenson]

* Changed 0.blank? to false rather than true since it violates everyone's expectation of blankness.  #2518, #2705 [rails@jeffcole.net]

* When loading classes using const_missing, raise a NameError if and only if the file we tried to load was not present. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added petabytes and exebytes to numeric extensions #2397 [timct@mac.com]

* Added Time#end_of_month to accompany Time#beginning_of_month #2514 [Jens-Christian Fischer]


*1.2.2* (October 26th, 2005)

* Set Logger.silencer = false to disable Logger#silence.  Useful for debugging fixtures.

* Add title case method to String to do, e.g., 'action_web_service'.titlecase #  => 'Action Web Service'. [Marcel Molina Jr.]


*1.2.1* (October 19th, 2005)

* Classify generated routing code as framework code to avoid appearing in application traces. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Show all framework frames in the framework trace. [Nicholas Seckar]


*1.2.0* (October 16th, 2005)

* Update Exception extension to show the first few framework frames in an application trace. [Nicholas Seckar] 

* Added Exception extension to provide support for clean backtraces. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Updated whiny nil to be more concise and useful. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Enumerable#first_match [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed that Time#change should also reset usec when also resetting minutes #2459 [ikeda@dream.big.or.jp]

* Fix Logger compatibility for distributions that don't keep Ruby and its standard library in sync.

* Replace '%e' from long and short time formats as Windows does not support it. #2344. [Tom Ward <tom@popdog.net>]

* Added to_s(:db) to Range, so you can get "BETWEEN '2005-12-10' AND '2005-12-12'" from Date.new(2005, 12, 10)..Date.new(2005, 12, 12) (and likewise with Times)

* Moved require_library_or_gem into Kernel. #1992 [Michael Schuerig <michael@schuerig.de>]

* Add :rfc822 as an option for Time#to_s (to get rfc822-formatted times)

* Chain the const_missing hook to any previously existing hook so rails can play nicely with rake

* Clean logger is compatible with both 1.8.2 and 1.8.3 Logger.  #2263 [Michael Schuerig <michael@schuerig.de>]

* Added native, faster implementations of .blank? for the core types #2286 [skae]

* Fixed clean logger to work with Ruby 1.8.3 Logger class #2245

* Fixed memory leak with Active Record classes when Dependencies.mechanism = :load #1704 [c.r.mcgrath@gmail.com]

* Fixed Inflector.underscore for use with acronyms, so HTML becomes html instead of htm_l #2173 [k@v2studio.com]

* Fixed inflections for status, quiz, move #2056 [deirdre@deirdre.net]

* Added Hash#reverse_merge, Hash#reverse_merge!, and Hash#reverse_update to ease the use of default options

* Added Array#to_sentence that'll turn ['one', 'two', 'three'] into "one, two, and three" #2157 [m.stienstra@fngtps.com]

* Added Kernel#silence_warnings to turn off warnings temporarily for the passed block

* Added String#starts_with? and String#ends_with? #2118 [thijs@vandervossen.net]

* Added easy extendability to the inflector through Inflector.inflections (using the Inflector::Inflections singleton class). Examples:

    Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
      inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1\2en'
      inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
    
      inflect.irregular 'octopus', 'octopi'
    
      inflect.uncountable "equipment"
    end

* Added String#at, String#from, String#to, String#first, String#last in ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::String::Access to ease access to individual characters and substrings in a string serving basically as human names for range access.

* Make Time#last_month work when invoked on the 31st of a month.

* Factor Fixnum and Bignum extensions into Integer extensions [Nicholas Seckar]

* Hooked #ordinalize into Fixnum and Bignum classes. [Nicholas Seckar, danp]

* Added Fixnum#ordinalize to turn 1.ordinalize to "1st", 3.ordinalize to "3rd", and 10.ordinalize to "10th" and so on #1724 [paul@cnt.org]


*1.1.1* (11 July, 2005)

* Added more efficient implementation of the development mode reset of classes #1638 [Chris McGrath]


*1.1.0* (6 July, 2005)

* Fixed conflict with Glue gem #1606 [Rick Olson]

* Added new rules to the Inflector to deal with more unusual plurals mouse/louse => mice/lice, information => information, ox => oxen, virus => viri, archive => archives #1571, #1583, #1490, #1599, #1608 [foamdino@gmail.com/others]

* Fixed memory leak with Object#remove_subclasses_of, which inflicted a Rails application running in development mode with a ~20KB leak per request #1289 [c.r.mcgrath@gmail.com]

* Made 1.year == 365.25.days to account for leap years.  This allows you to do User.find(:all, :conditions => ['birthday > ?', 50.years.ago]) without losing a lot of days.  #1488 [tuxie@dekadance.se]

* Added an exception if calling id on nil to WhinyNil #584 [kevin-temp@writesoon.com]

* Added Fix/Bignum#multiple_of? which returns true on 14.multiple_of?(7) and false on 16.multiple_of?(7) #1464 [Thomas Fuchs]

* Added even? and odd? to work with Bignums in addition to Fixnums #1464 [Thomas Fuchs]

* Fixed Time#at_beginning_of_week returned the next Monday instead of the previous one when called on a Sunday #1403 [jean.helou@gmail.com]

* Increased the speed of indifferent hash access by using Hash#default.  #1436 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added that "   " is now also blank? (using strip if available)

* Fixed Dependencies so all modules are able to load missing constants #1173 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed the Inflector to underscore strings containing numbers, so Area51Controller becomes area51_controller #1176 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed that HashWithIndifferentAccess stringified all keys including symbols, ints, objects, and arrays #1162 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed Time#last_year to go back in time, not forward #1278 [fabien@odilat.com]

* Fixed the pluralization of analysis to analyses #1295 [seattle@rootimage.msu.edu]

* Fixed that Time.local(2005,12).months_since(1) would raise "ArgumentError: argument out of range" #1311 [jhahn@niveon.com]

* Added silencing to the default Logger class


*1.0.4* (19th April, 2005)

* Fixed that in some circumstances controllers outside of modules may have hidden ones inside modules. For example, admin/content might have been hidden by /content. #1075 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed inflection of perspectives and similar words #1045 [thijs@vandervossen.net]

* Added Fixnum#even? and Fixnum#odd?

* Fixed problem with classes being required twice. Object#const_missing now uses require_dependency to load files. It used to use require_or_load which would cause models to be loaded twice, which was not good for validations and other class methods #971 [Nicholas Seckar]


*1.0.3* (27th March, 2005)

* Fixed Inflector.pluralize to handle capitalized words #932 [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added Object#suppress which allows you to make a saner choice around with exceptions to swallow #980. Example:

    suppress(ZeroDivisionError) { 1/0 }
  
  ...instead of:
  
    1/0 rescue nil # BAD, EVIL, DIRTY.


*1.0.2* (22th March, 2005)

* Added Kernel#returning -- a Ruby-ized realization of the K combinator, courtesy of Mikael Brockman.

    def foo
      returning values = [] do
        values << 'bar'
        values << 'baz'
      end
    end
    
    foo # => ['bar', 'baz']


*1.0.1* (7th March, 2005)

* Fixed Hash#indifferent_access to also deal with include? and fetch and nested hashes #726 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Object#blank? -- see http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/objectBlank.html #783 [_why the lucky stiff]

* Added inflection rules for "sh" words, like "wish" and "fish" #755 [phillip@pjbsoftware.com]

* Fixed an exception when using Ajax based requests from Safari because Safari appends a \000 to the post body. Symbols can't have \000 in them so indifferent access would throw an exception in the constructor. Indifferent hashes now use strings internally instead. #746 [Tobias Luetke]

* Added String#to_time and String#to_date for wrapping ParseDate


*1.0.0* (24th February, 2005)

* Added TimeZone as the first of a number of value objects that among others Active Record can use rich value objects using composed_of #688 [Jamis Buck]

* Added Date::Conversions for getting dates in different convenient string representations and other objects

* Added Time::Conversions for getting times in different convenient string representations and other objects

* Added Time::Calculations to ask for things like Time.now.tomorrow, Time.now.yesterday, Time.now.months_ago(4) #580 [DP|Flurin]. Examples:

    "Later today"         => now.in(3.hours),
    "Tomorrow morning"    => now.tomorrow.change(:hour => 9),
    "Tomorrow afternoon"  => now.tomorrow.change(:hour => 14),
    "In a couple of days" => now.tomorrow.tomorrow.change(:hour => 9),
    "Next monday"         => now.next_week.change(:hour => 9),
    "In a month"          => now.next_month.change(:hour => 9),
    "In 6 months"         => now.months_since(6).change(:hour => 9),
    "In a year"           => now.in(1.year).change(:hour => 9)

* Upgraded to breakpoint 92 which fixes:

    * overload IRB.parse_opts(), fixes #443
      => breakpoints in tests work even when running them via rake
    * untaint handlers, might fix an issue discussed on the Rails ML
    * added verbose mode to breakpoint_client
    * less noise caused by breakpoint_client by default
    * ignored TerminateLineInput exception in signal handler
      => quiet exit on Ctrl-C

* Fixed Inflector for words like "news" and "series" that are the same in plural and singular #603 [echion], #615 [marcenuc]

* Added Hash#stringify_keys and Hash#stringify_keys!

* Added IndifferentAccess as a way to wrap a hash by a symbol-based store that also can be accessed by string keys

* Added that Inflector.camelize and Inflector.underscore can deal with modules like turning "Admin::User" into "admin/user" and back

* Added Inflector.humanize to turn attribute names like employee_salary into "Employee salary". Used by automated error reporting in AR.

* Added availability of class inheritable attributes to the masses #477 [Jeremy Kemper]

    class Foo
      class_inheritable_reader :read_me
      class_inheritable_writer :write_me
      class_inheritable_accessor :read_and_write_me
      class_inheritable_array :read_and_concat_me
      class_inheritable_hash :read_and_update_me
    end

    # Bar gets a clone of (not a reference to) Foo's attributes.
    class Bar < Foo
    end

    Bar.read_and_write_me == Foo.read_and_write_me
    Bar.read_and_write_me = 'bar'
    Bar.read_and_write_me != Foo.read_and_write_me

* Added Inflections as an extension on String, so Inflector.pluralize(Inflector.classify(name)) becomes name.classify.pluralize #476 [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added Byte operations to Numeric, so 5.5.megabytes + 200.kilobytes #461 [Marcel Molina]

* Fixed that Dependencies.reload can't load the same file twice #420 [Kent Sibilev]

* Added Fixnum#ago/until, Fixnum#since/from_now #450 [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added that Inflector now accepts Symbols and Classes by calling .to_s on the word supplied

* Added time unit extensions to Fixnum that'll return the period in seconds, like 2.days + 4.hours.
