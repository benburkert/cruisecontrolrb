h1. The Manual

h2. Files and folders

If CC.rb is unpacked into [cruise] directory, then:

* [cruise]/builds/ is the projects directory.

* [cruise]/builds/your_project/ is a directory for the project called "your_project".

* [cruise]/builds/your_project/work/ is a local copy of your_project's source code. Builder keeps it up to date
  with the source control repository and runs builds against it.

* [cruise]/builds/your_project/build-123/ contains build status file, list of changed files,
  and other "build artifacts" created while building revision 123.

* [cruise]/builds/your_project/project_config.rb is builder configuration for your_project.

* [cruise]/config/site_config.rb is the file where you can make centralized changes to the configuration of dashboard
  and all builders.


h2. Project builder configuration

When you add a project to it, CruiseControl.rb will try to do something reasonable without any configuration.

However, there are things that builder cannot know in advance. For example, who needs to receive an email notice
when the build is broken. Default answer is <em>"nobody"</em>, and it may be good enough if you use CCTray or have a
big projector screen displaying the dashboard to monitor the build status. What if it's not good enough?
To make the builder aware of all these other things that you want it to do, you will have to write them down in a
project configuration file.

Rolling your eyes already? Hold on, this is not J2EE deployment descriptors we are talking about. No two pages of
hand-crafted angled brackets just to get started here. A typical project configuration is about 3 to 5 lines of very
simple Ruby. Yes, the configuration language of CC.rb is Ruby.

In [cruise]/builds/your_project/ directory, create file project_config.rb. Write the following in it:

<pre><code>Project.configure do |project|
end
</code></pre>

Every project_config.rb must have these two lines. All your other configuration goes between them.

p(hint). Hint: configuration examples below include lines that look like '...' This represents other
         configuration statements that may be in project_config.rb. You are not meant to copy-paste those dots into
         your configuration file. If you do, <code>./cruise start</code> will fail to start, saying something about
         syntax error (SyntaxError). Understandably, ... is not a valid Ruby expression.


h2. What will it build by default?

By default, CC.rb will search for "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ build file in your project. Then
CC.rb will try to execute <code>cruise</code> task if it is defined. If it is not, it will try to perform standard Rails
tasks that prepare a test database by deleting everything from it and executing
"migration":http://www.rubyonrails.org/api/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html scripts from your_project/db/migrate.
Finally, it will run all your automated tests.

p(hint). We have a "more detailed description":rake_tasks.html of default build behavior. However, if default build
behavior doesn't suit you for any reason, the easiest way around it is to define a <code>cruise</code> task in your own
Rakefile, and do everything through that task and its dependencies.


h2. How to change what the build does?

<code>cruise</code> may be the task for a quick build, but you may also want to run a long build with all acceptance
tests included. This can be done by assigning <code>project.rake_task</code> attribute in project_config.rb:

<pre><code>Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.rake_task = 'Big_Bertha_build'
  ...
end
</code></pre>

p(hint). Hint: When you have two builds for the same projects, and want to run them on the same build server, it
         actually takes more than just a different Rake task. At the very least, you want to have separate databases
         for those two builds. You can achieve this by creating a separate environment and setting RAILS_ENV to it in
         your Rakefile. Copy config/environments/test.rb to config/environments/big_bertha.rb and write something like
         <code>ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'big_bertha'</code> as the first line of your <code>Big_Bertha_build</code> Rake task.

p(hint). Hint: Ideally, you'd also want some way to chain builds so that the long build only for a new checkin is
         launched once the short build has finished succesfully. For now, you can achieve something this with custom
         schedulers. CruiseControl.rb team intends to provide built-in support for this scenario in a future version.

Or you may not want to deal with Rake at all, but build your project by "make":http://www.gnu.org/software/make/,
"Ant":http://ant.apache.org/ or "MSBuild":http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wea2sca5.aspx (yes, CC.rb should be
able to cope with non-Ruby projects!). 

p(hint). So far, this statement is mostly theoretical. None of the authors actually used CruiseControl.rb with anything
         but Rake. Please let us know if for some reason this feature doesn't work for you.

A custom build command can be set in <code>project.build_command</code> attribute. Modify project_config.rb file like
this:

<pre><code>Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.build_command = 'my_build_script.sh'
  ...
end
</code></pre>

If <code>project.build_command</code> is set, CC.rb will change current working directory to
[cruise]/builds/your_project/work/, invoke specified command and look at the exit code to determine whether the
build passed or failed.

p(hint) You cannot specify both <code>rake_task</code> and <code>build_command</code> attributes in project_config.rb.
        It doesn't make sense, anyway.


h2. What should I do with custom build artifacts?

your_project may have a special build task, producing some output that you want to keep, and see on
the build page.

p(hint). Hint: Code coverage analysis is a good example of custom build output. CruiseControl.rb's own build uses
         "rcov":http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb. If you drill down into a recent CC.rb build on
         "http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com":http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com, you can see links
         to test coverage reports.

Before running the build, CC.rb sets OS variable <strong>CC_BUILD_ARTIFACTS</strong> to the directory
where the build artifacts are collected. Make sure that your special task writes its output to that directory, or a
subdirectory under that directory.

The build page includes links to every file or subdirectory found in the build artifacts directory.


h2. Build monitoring via email

CruiseControl.rb can send email notices whenever build is broken or fixed. To make it happen, you need to tell it how
to send email, and who to send it to. Do the following:

1. Configure SMTP server connection. Copy [cruise]/config/site_config.rb_example to ~cruise/config/site_config.rb,
   read it and edit according to your situation.

2. Tell the builder, whom do you want to receive build notices, by placing the following line in project_config.rb:

<pre><code>Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.email_notifier.emails = ['john@doe.com', 'jane@doe.com']
  ...
end
</code></pre>


h2. Build notices via instant messaging with Jabber

"Jabber":http://www.jabber.org/ is an open protocol for instant messaging. Jabber messages can be sent to all sorts of
IM systems, including AIM, Google Talk, ICQ, IRC, MSN and Yahoo. CC.rb comes with a Jabber plugin. Look
at [cruise]/builder_plugins/available/jabber_notifier/README for the installation guide and further details.


h2. Build monitoring with CCTray

"CCTray":http://ccnet.sourceforge.net/CCNET/CCTray.html is a utility developed as part of CruiseControl.NET project
that displays an icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. The icon changes its color to red when a build fails,
and back to green when the build is fixed.

CruiseControl.rb can be monitored by CCTray. To connect CCTray to CC.rb server, start CCTray, right click on CCTray
icon, select Settings..., click on Add button, click on Add Server button, select "Via CruiseControl.NET Dashboard"
option and type http://<cruise_host>:3333 in the text box. Click OK, select your project, click OK again, close the
Settings dialog. Voila, you are monitoring your build with CCTray.

At the time of this writing, CC.rb was tested to work with CCTray 1.2.1
<small>("download":http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ccnet/CruiseControl.NET-CCTray-1.2.1-Setup.exe?modtime=1170786355&big_mirror=0)</small>

p(hint). Hint: CCTRay only works on a Windows desktop.


h2. Build scheduling

By default, the builder polls Subversion every 10 seconds for new revisions. This can be changed by adding the
following line to project_config.rb:


<pre><code>Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.scheduler.polling_interval = 5.minutes
  ...
end
</code></pre>

What if you want a scheduler with some interesting logic? Well, a default scheduler can be substituted by placing
your own scheduler implementation intpo the plugins directory and writing in project_config.rb something like this:

<pre><code>Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.scheduler = MyCustomScheduler.new(project)
  ...
end
</code></pre>

After initializing everything, and loading the project (step that includes evaluation of project_config.rb), the
builder invokes project.scheduler.run. Project may detect that its configuraton has changed, so a scheduler needs to
know how to recognize that situation.

Look at [cruise]/app/models/polling_scheduler.rb to understand how a scheduler interacts with a project.


h2. Deleting a project

To remove your_project from CruiseControl.rb, kill its builder process and then delete the [cruise]/builds/your_project/
directory.


h2. Troubleshooting and support

Beware, at the time of this writing, CC.rb is very young and not very stable. Good news is that it's simple (much, much
simpler than other CruiseControl incarnations). The dashboard is just a small Rails app, and the builder is little
more than a dumb, single-threaded Ruby script. Therefore, it's easy to debug. So, you are your own support hotline.
Don't forget to send us patches, please!

OK, that was the pep talk. If you have an issue that you cannot fix on your own, subscribe to mail list
cruisecontrolrb-users@rubyforge.org and ask for help.

h2. Documentation that we haven't written yet

We should write about ways to run CC.rb as a service on various platforms, write about various troubleshooting
techniques, document builder plugins etc.

p(hint). Hint to would-be contributors: documentation patches will be appreciated as highly as, if not higher than,
source patches.
