== CruiseControl.rb

=== What's this?
CruiseControl.rb is a continuous integration tool. Its basic purpose in life is to alert members of a software project 
when one of them checks into a source control system something that breaks the build.

CC.rb is easy to install, pleasant to use and simple to hack. It's written in Ruby.

=== The Concept
See Martin Fowler's article about Continuous Integration: http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html

=== Basics
CC.rb consists of a builder and a dashboard. 

Builder is a daemon that polls source control every once in a while for new revisions.

When someone performs a check in, the builder detects it, updates its own copy of the project, runs the build and
notifies interested parties about build outcome.

Dashboard is a web application to monitor and troubleshoot build status of projects.

Each installation of CC.rb may have multiple projects, and multiple builders (one per project). There may also be
multiple installations of CC.rb per computer.

=== Prerequisites
* Ruby 1.8.4 or later
* Subversion client 1.3.2 or later. svn executable must be on the PATH.

=== Assumptions
* CC.rb currently only works with Subversion.
* To build your_project, builder needs to go to ~cruise/builds/your_project/work/ and execute 'rake' there.

=== Installation
1. Download and unpack CruiseControl.rb (we'll call the place you unpack it <cruise>)
2. From <cruise>, run "ruby script/server" with Ruby 1.8.4 or greater.
3. Browse to http://localhost:3000. If the dashboard is running fine and dandy, you will see a page with
   CruiseControl.rb logo.
4. Create a directory for project's builds <cruise>/builds/<your_project>
5. Refresh the dashboard. It should now display your_project, with status "Never built".
6. Checkout your project's source code to <cruise>/builds/<your_project>/work, for example:
     svn checkout http://localhost/svn/your_project/trunk builds/your_project/work
7. Go to <cruise>/builds/<your_project>/work/ and run the build. Do whatever is necessary to make it pass.
8. Go back to <cruise> and run "ruby script/builder -p <your_project>".
 
   Hint: Monitor log/your_project_builder.log for any signs of trouble. Try to check in a change to your_project
   and see if builder can detect and build it.  Check your_project status in the dashboard.

   Hint: If you want to run your server on a different port, just use "ruby script/server -p <port>"

=== Files and folders
If CC.rb is unpacked into ~cruise directory, then:

  ~cruise/builds/ is the projects directory.

  ~cruise/builds/your_project/ is a directory for project called "your_project".

  ~cruise/builds/your_project/work/ is a local copy of the your_project's source code. Builder keeps it up to date 
  with the source control repository and runs builds against it.

	~cruise/builds/your_project/build-123 contains status, list of changed files, and other "build artifacts" created 
	while building revision 123.
	
	~cruise/builds/your_project/project_config.rb contains builder configuration for your_project.

  ~cruise/config/site_config.rb is where you can make centralized changes to the configuration of dashboard and all 
  builders.

=== Email notification
CruiseControl.rb can send email whenever build fails or is fixed. To make it happen, you need to tell it how to send 
email, and who to send it to. Do the following:

1. Configure SMTP server connection. Copy ~cruise/config/site_config.rb_example to ~cruise/config/site_config.rb, 
   read it and edit according to your situation.

2. Tell the builder who to email. Copy ~cruise/config/project_config.rb_example to 
   ~cruise/builds/your_project/project_config.rb and edit the list of email addresses there.

=== Troubleshooting and support
Beware, at the time of this writing, CC.rb is very young and not very stable. Good news is that it's simple (much, much 
simpler than other CruiseControl incarnations). The dashboard is just a small Rails app, and the builder is little 
more than a dumb, single-threaded Ruby script. Therefore, it's easy to debug. So, you are your own support hotline. 
Don't forget to send us patches, please!

OK, that was the pep talk. If you have an issue that you cannot fix on your own, email Alex or Jeremy.
