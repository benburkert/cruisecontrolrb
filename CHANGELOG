* 1.0.0
  - IMPORTANT: 'project_config.rb' renamed to 'cruise_config.rb'
  - IMPORTANT: RAILS_ENV is not set to "test" before calling "cruise" or a custom Rake task 
  - checkins (and comments) now show up on dashboard
  - cruise_config.rb can be in either [cruise]/projects/my_project/ or [cruise]/projects/my_project/work/. In other
    words, cruise_config.rb can be placed directly into the version control and obtained from there.
  - Build Now button changes buider state to 'build requested' immediately upon click 
  - long lines on build page are better after putting the build log on the right column, they scroll off the screen,
    but not under build list

  - IMPORTANT: working directory renamed from 'builds' to 'projects'
  - drill down from error message to to source code  
  - when builder detects a change to cruise_config.rb, it automatically reloads the project (no need to restart
    the builder)
  - 'cruise start' starts dashboard and all project builders (unless -e development or --without-builders option is
    specified)
  - 'cruise start' starts dashboard in production environment. Use 'cruise start -e development' for development.
  - more, and better, documentation
  - plugin for sending build notices as instant messages via Jabber protocol (should work with IRC, ICQ, Yahoo, MSN,
    Google Talk or anything else that has a Jabber transport).
  - 'build add' does not create cruise_config.rb, and therefore does not write down SVN user/password (relying on
    password caching and/or key-based authentication and/or read-only anonymous access.  
  - builder plugins receive build_broken and build_fixed events when build status goes from green to red and vice versa
  - RSS feed

  - browser autorefresh - seeing latest build status without hitting 'refresh' on browser
  - builder's current activity (down/sleeping/checking for modifications/building) on the dashboard
  - builder plugin may be packaged as a directory with multiple files. It must have init.rb then.
  - plugin error handler: if a plugin raises an error in response to notification, builder logs the error, 
    notifies all other plugins, then raises an error of its own (thus triggering the build_loop_failed event)
  - improved error handling during builder initialization
  - Bugfix: blocked spaces in project names
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.3.0
  - builder is building 'cruise', 'test' or 'default' target, depending on what is defined in the project
  - when build is running, OS variable CC_BUILD_ARTIFACTS is pointing to the build artifacts directory

  - Handling of build loop errors (other than 'Build Failed')
  - improved logging
  - if builder is invoked with --trace option, it calls Rake with --trace option, too
