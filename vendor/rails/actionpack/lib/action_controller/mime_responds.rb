      # Without web-service support, an action which collects the data for displaying a list of people
      # might look something like this:
      #
      #   def index
      #     @people = Person.find(:all)
      #   end
      # 
      # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
      # 
      #   def index
      #     @people = Person.find(:all)
      # 
      #     respond_to do |format|
      #       format.html
      #       format.xml { render :xml => @people.to_xml }
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # What that says is, "if the client wants HTML in response to this action, just respond as we 
      # would have before, but if the client wants XML, return them the list of people in XML format." 
      # (Rails determines the desired response format from the HTTP Accept header submitted by the client.)
      # 
      # Supposing you have an action that adds a new person, optionally creating their company 
      # (by name) if it does not already exist, without web-services, it might look like this:
      # 
      #   def create
      #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(params[:company][:name])
      #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
      # 
      #     redirect_to(person_list_url)
      #   end
      # 
      # Here's the same action, with web-service support baked in:
      # 
      #   def create
      #     company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
      #     @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
      #     @person  = @company.people.create(params[:person])
      # 
      #     respond_to do |format|
      #       format.html { redirect_to(person_list_url) }
      #       format.js
      #       format.xml  { render :xml => @person.to_xml(:include => @company) }
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # If the client wants HTML, we just redirect them back to the person list. If they want Javascript 
      # (wants.js), then it is an RJS request and we render the RJS template associated with this action. 
      # Lastly, if the client wants XML, we render the created person as XML, but with a twist: we also 
      # include the person’s company in the rendered XML, so you get something like this:
      # 
      #   <person>
      #     <id>...</id>
      #     ...
      #     <company>
      #       <id>...</id>
      #       <name>...</name>
      #       ...
      #     </company>
      #   </person>
      # 
      # Note, however, the extra bit at the top of that action:
      # 
      #   company  = params[:person].delete(:company)
      #   @company = Company.find_or_create_by_name(company[:name])
      # 
      # This is because the incoming XML document (if a web-service request is in process) can only contain a 
      # single root-node. So, we have to rearrange things so that the request looks like this (url-encoded):
      # 
      #   person[name]=...&person[company][name]=...&...
      # 
      # And, like this (xml-encoded):
      # 
      #   <person>
      #     <name>...</name>
      #     <company>
      #       <name>...</name>
      #     </company>
      #   </person>
      # 
      # In other words, we make the request so that it operates on a single entity—a person. Then, in the action, 
      # we extract the company data from the request, find or create the company, and then create the new person 
      # with the remaining data.
      # 
      # Note that you can define your own XML parameter parser which would allow you to describe multiple entities 
      # in a single request (i.e., by wrapping them all in a single root note), but if you just go with the flow 
      # and accept Rails' defaults, life will be much easier.
      # 
      # If you need to use a MIME type which isn't supported by default, you can register your own handlers in
      # environment.rb as follows.
      # 
      #   Mime::Type.register "image/jpg", :jpg
