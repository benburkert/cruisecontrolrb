Description:
    The session table migration generator creates a migration for adding a session table 
    used by CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore.

    The generator takes a migration name as its argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate session_migration AddSessionTable

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddSessionTable migration in the
    file db/migrate/005_add_session_table.rb
