h1. Getting Started


h2. Word from authors

<div class="letter">
*Dear build -monkey- -master- artist,*

We created CruiseControl.rb so that you can kick ass.

We want you to have basic continuous integration up and running in the next 15 minutes after reading this page.
After that, we want you to find that the tool looks pretty, does what you expect, and basically just
works. Finally, when you need to do something unusual, we want you to be surprised by how easy that was, too.

In short, we want you to *love* CruiseControl.rb.

Very truly yours,<br/>
<br/>
CruiseControl.rb team<br/>
ThoughtWorks<br/>

<small>P.S. We also want to know if we somehow fall short of this goal.</small>
</div>

h2. Basics

CruiseControl.rb consists of a builder and a dashboard.

Builder is a daemon process that polls source control every once in a while for new revisions.

When someone performs a check in, the builder detects it, updates its own copy of the project, runs the build and
notifies interested parties about build outcome.

Dashboard is a web application that helps to monitor the status of project build and troubleshoot failures.

Each installation of CruiseControl.rb may have multiple projects and multiple builders (one per project). There may also be
multiple installations of CruiseControl.rb per computer.


h2. Prerequisites

* "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ 1.8.4 or later
* "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ client 1.3.2 or later
* svn and ruby executables must both be on the PATH.


h2. Assumptions and limitations

* CruiseControl.rb currently only works with Subversion.
* Dashboard and all builders should run on the same computer.


h2. Installation

1. Download and unpack CruiseControl.rb (below, we will refer to the place where you unpack it as [cruise])

2. From [cruise], run <code>./cruise start</code>.

3. Browse to "http://localhost:3333":http://localhost:3333. All going well, weather permitting, you will see a
   page with CruiseControl.rb logo. This is the dashboard. Of course, there are no projects to build yet... 

4. Run <code>./cruise add your_project --url <URL of your_project Subversion trunk></code>.
   Optionally, you can specify username and password by adding <code> --username <your_user> --password
   <your_password></code> to the command. This creates a directory for your_project's builds at [cruise]/builds/your_project/,
   and checks out your_project from subversion URL specified to [cruise]/builds/your_project/work/.

   p(hint). Rakefile of your_project should be in [cruise]/builds/your_project/work/ directory, not anywhere under
   it. A common mistake is to specify in --url option the root of project's SVN repository instead of the trunk.
   Rakefile then ends up in [cruise]/builds/your_project/work/trunk/ and CruiseControl.rb does not see it there.

5. Look at the dashboard again. It should now display your_project, with status "Never built".

6. Go to [cruise]/builds/your_project/work/ and make the build pass. For a regular Rails app, this involves creating
   a test database, editing database.yml to connect to that database, performing
   <code>rake RAILS_ENV=test db:migrate</code> and making sure that <code>rake test</code> passes.

7. Go back to [cruise] and run <code>./cruise build your_project</code>. This should build your_project, place build
   outputs into [cruise]/builds/your_project/build-[revision-number]/

   p(hint). Hint: Monitor log/your_project_builder.log for any signs of trouble. Try to check in a change to
            your_project and see if builder can detect and build it.  Check your_project status in the dashboard.

   p(hint). Hint: If you want to run your server on a different port, just use <code>./cruise start -p [port]</code>.

   p(hint). Hint: <code>./cruise help</code> displays a list of commands, <code>./cruise help [command]</code>
            displays options available for each
   command.
