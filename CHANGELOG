TRUNK
  - builder plugin may be packaged as a directory with multiple files. It must have init.rb then.
  - plugin error handler: if a plugin raises an error in response to notification, builder logs the error, 
    notifies all other plugins, then raises an error of its own (thus triggering the build_loop_failed event)
  - improved error handling during builder initialization
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.3.0
  - builder is building 'cruise', 'test' or 'default' target, depending on what is defined in the project
  - when build is running, OS variable CC_BUILD_ARTIFACTS is pointing to the build artifacts directory
  - customizable Rake task and build command
  - customizable polling interval
  - Handling of build loop errors (other than 'Build Failed')
  - improved logging
  - if builder is invoked with --trace option, it calls Rake with --trace option, too
  - Bugfix: explicitly require 'rubygems' before trying to require 'rake', do not rely on RUBYOPT=-rubygems to be set.
  - Bugfix: Adding a project a second time deletes the original
  - Bugfix: Parsing SVN log output for a revision made by anonymous author
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.2.0
  - Unified command-line interface to web app, builder and add_project script
  - Default port changed to 3333 (to avoid clashing with other Rails apps)
  - Bugfix: builder invoking Rake with RAILS_ENV OS variable set to 'builder'
  - Bugfix: not all Windows installations have rake.cmd
  - Bugfix: CC.rb trying to build itself when a project has no Rakefile
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.1.0
  - Initial release.
