= 0.4.0

- Allow naming of mocks (patch from Chris Roos).
- Specify multiple return values for consecutive calls.
- Improved consistency of expectation error messages.
- Allow mocking of Object instance methods e.g. kind_of?, type.
- Provide aliased versions of #expects and #stubs to allow mocking of these methods.
- Added at_least, at_most, at_most_once methods to expectation.
- Allow expects and stubs to take a hash of method and return values.
- Eliminate warning: "instance variable @yield not initialized" (patch from Xavier Shay).
- Restore instance methods on partial mocks (patch from Chris Roos).
- Allow stubbing of a method with non-word characters in its name (patch from Paul Battley).
- Removed coupling to Test::Unit.
- Allow specified exception instance to be raised (patch from Chris Roos).
- Make mock object_id appear in hex like normal Ruby inspect (patch from Paul Battley).
- Fix path to object.rb in rdoc rake task (patch from Tomas Pospisek).
- Reverse order in which expectations are matched, so that last expectation is matched first. This allows e.g. a call to #stubs to be effectively overridden by a call to #expects (patch from Tobias Lutke).
- Stubba & SmartTestCase modules incorporated into Mocha module so only need to require 'mocha' - no longer need to require 'stubba'.
- AutoMocha removed.

= 0.3.3

- Quick bug fix to restore instance methods on partial mocks (for Kevin Clark).

= 0.3.2

- Examples added.

= 0.3.1

- Dual licensing with MIT license added.

= 0.3.0

* Rails plugin.
* Auto-verify for expectations on concrete classes.
* Include each expectation verification in the test result assertion count.
* Filter out noise from assertion backtraces.
* Point assertion backtrace to line where failing expectation was created.
* New yields method for expectations.
* Create stubs which stub all method calls.
* Mocks now respond_to? expected methods.

= 0.2.1

* Rename MochaAcceptanceTest::Rover#move method to avoid conflict with Rake (in Ruby 1.8.4 only?)

= 0.2.0

* Small change to SetupAndTeardown#teardown_stubs suggested by Luke Redpath (http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk) to allow use of Stubba with RSpec (http://rspec.rubyforge.org).
* Reorganized directory structure and extracted addition of setup and teardown methods into SmartTestCase mini-library.
* Addition of auto-verify for Mocha (but not Stubba). This means there is more significance in the choice of expects or stubs in that any expects on a mock will automatically get verified.

So instead of...

  wotsit = Mocha.new
  wotsit.expects(:thingummy).with(5).returns(10)
  doobrey = Doobrey.new(wotsit)
  doobrey.hoojamaflip
  wotsit.verify

you need to do...

  wotsit = mock()
  wotsit.expects(:thingummy).with(5).returns(10)
  doobrey = Doobrey.new(wotsit)
  doobrey.hoojamaflip
  # no need to verify

There are also shortcuts as follows...

instead of...

  wotsit = Mocha.new
  wotsit.expects(:thingummy).returns(10)
  wotsit.expects(:summat).returns(25)

you can have...

  wotsit = mock(:thingummy => 5, :summat => 25)

and instead of...

  wotsit = Mocha.new
  wotsit.stubs(:thingummy).returns(10)
  wotsit.stubs(:summat).returns(25)

you can have...

  wotsit = stub(:thingummy => 5, :summat => 25)

= 0.1.2

* Minor tweaks

= 0.1.1

* Initial release.
