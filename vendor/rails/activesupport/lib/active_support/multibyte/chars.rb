# Encapsulates all the functionality related to the Chars proxy.
module ActiveSupport::Multibyte #:nodoc:
  # Chars enables you to work transparently with multibyte encodings in the Ruby String class without having extensive
  # knowledge about the encoding. A Chars object accepts a string upon initialization and proxies String methods in an
  # encoding safe manner. All the normal String methods are also implemented on the proxy.
  #
  # String methods are proxied through the Chars object, and can be accessed through the +chars+ method. Methods
  # which would normally return a String object now return a Chars object so methods can be chained.
  #
  #   "The Perfect String  ".chars.downcase.strip.normalize #=> "the perfect string"
  #
  # Chars objects are perfectly interchangeable with String objects as long as no explicit class checks are made.
  # If certain methods do explicitly check the class, call +to_s+ before you pass chars objects to them.
  #
  #   bad.explicit_checking_method "T".chars.downcase.to_s
  #
  # The actual operations on the string are delegated to handlers. Theoretically handlers can be implemented for
  # any encoding, but the default handler handles UTF-8. This handler is set during initialization, if you want to
  # use you own handler, you can set it on the Chars class. Look at the UTF8Handler source for an example how to
  # implement your own handler. If you your own handler to work on anything but UTF-8 you probably also
  # want to override Chars#handler.
  #
  #   ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars.handler = MyHandler
  #
  # Note that a few methods are defined on Chars instead of the handler because they are defined on Object or Kernel
  # and method_missing can't catch them.
