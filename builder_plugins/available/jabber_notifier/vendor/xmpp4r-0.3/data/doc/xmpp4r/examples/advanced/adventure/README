What is this?

This is an example of what you can do with XMPP4R. It is a conferencing
component in which you can walk around, travel to various places, look
at things and talk to other visitors on the same places. If you like
Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) this is for you!

How does it work?

The component loads a few worlds from a few XML files. Each world is a
component. Once joined the chat will tell you what you can do. Remember
that you can get a command listing anytime by saying '?'.

Reading 'You can go north, west' you may say 'go north' to go in the
northern direction and 'go west' to go in the western direction. You'll
then find yourself at some other place but still in the same MUC
conference. Your groupchat roster will change as you'll notice different
people and things that are just in the same place, not other places.

Before starting to hack the scripts you may want to take a look at
tower.xml. Note that users are <thing/>s, too and the whole world could
be serialized back to XML by just issuing "world.to_s".

Please note that the code, especially the error handling, is of extreme
poor quality and was mostly written in one afternoon. If I'm going to
develop this further everything should be rewritten...

How to try?

Because this is a component you are going to need your own Jabber
Daemon - which you'll need anyways if you're going to experiment with
XMPP4R. ;-)

Syntax:
./adventure.rb <JID> <Password> <Host>

Example:
./adventure.rb mud.example.com geheimnis localhost

Messages seem to have random order?

I don't know any solution for this. One may add short delays between
messages, but that would only be a very dirty hack.

RFC3920:

"10.  Server Rules for Handling XML Stanzas

Compliant server implementations MUST ensure in-order processing of
XML stanzas between any two entities."
