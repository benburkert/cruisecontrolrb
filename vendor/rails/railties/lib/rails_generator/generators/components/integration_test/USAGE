Description:
    The model generator creates a stub for a new integration test.

    The generator takes an integration test name as its argument.  The test
    name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed
    with 'Test'.

    The generator creates an integration test class in test/integration.

Example:
    ./script/generate integration_test GeneralStories

    This will create a GeneralStores integration test:
        test/integration/general_stories_test.rb
