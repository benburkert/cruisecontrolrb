h1. Welcome to CruiseControl.rb

CruiseControl.rb is a continuous integration tool. Its basic purpose in life is to alert members of a software project
when one of them checks into a source control system something that breaks the build.

CC.rb is easy to install, pleasant to use and simple to hack. It's written in Ruby.
