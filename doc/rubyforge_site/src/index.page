h1. Welcome to CruiseControl.rb

h2. What is this?

CruiseControl.rb is a continuous integration tool. Its basic purpose in life is to alert members of a software project
when one of them checks into a source control system something that breaks the build.

CC.rb is easy to install, pleasant to use and simple to hack. It's written in "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.

p(hint). Hint: "Martin Fowler":http://martinfowler.com/ explains the how and why of Continuous Integration in this
         "article":http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html.

* Works out of the box with a regular "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ or "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.org
  project. No configuration necessary.
