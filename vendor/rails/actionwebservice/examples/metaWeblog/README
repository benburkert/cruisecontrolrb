= metaWeblog example

This example shows how one might begin to go about adding metaWeblog
(http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) API support to a Rails-based
blogging application.

The example APIs are more verbose than you may want to make them, for documentation
reasons.

= Running

  1. Copy the "apis" directory and its files into "app" in a Rails project.

  2. Copy the "controllers" directory and its files into "app" in a Rails project

  3. Fire up a desktop blogging application (such as w.bloggar, MarsEdit, or BloGTK),
     point it at http://localhost:3000/xmlrpc/api, and try creating or editing blog posts.
