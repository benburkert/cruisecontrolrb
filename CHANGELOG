TRUNK

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0.3.0
  - builder is building 'cruise', 'test' or 'default' target, depending on what is defined in the project
  - when build is running, OS variable CC_BUILD_ARTIFACTS is pointing to the build artifacts directory
  - customizable Rake task and build command
  - customizable polling interval
  - Handling of build loop errors (other than 'Build Failed')
  - improved logging
  - if builder is invoked with --trace option, it calls Rake with --trace option, too

  - Bugfix: Adding a project a second time deletes the original
  - Bugfix: Parsing SVN log output for a revision made by anonymous author
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
