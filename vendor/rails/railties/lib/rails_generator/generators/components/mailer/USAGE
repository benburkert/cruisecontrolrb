Description:
    The mailer generator creates stubs for a new mailer and its views.

    The generator takes a mailer name and a list of views as arguments.
    The mailer name may be given in CamelCase or under_score.

    The generator creates a mailer class in app/models with view templates
    in app/views/mailer_name, and a test suite with fixtures in test/unit.

Example:
    ./script/generate mailer Notifications signup forgot_password invoice

    This will create a Notifications mailer class:
        Mailer:     app/models/notifications.rb
        Views:      app/views/notifications/signup.rhtml [...]
        Test:       test/unit/test/unit/notifications_test.rb
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/notifications/signup [...]
