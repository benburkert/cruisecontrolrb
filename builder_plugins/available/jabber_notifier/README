== Jabber notifier for CruiseControl.rb

=== What's this?

This is a builder plugin for CruiseControl.rb [http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com] that sends build notices
to instant messaging clients.

Jabber [http://www.jabber.org] is an open protocol for instant messaging. Jabber messages can be sent to all sorts of
IM systems, including AIM, Google Talk, ICQ, IRC, MSN and Yahoo.


=== Installation

1. Create a Jabber account that you will use for sending notifications.
2. Make sure that all who want to subscribe to build notices via Jabber can receive messages from this
   account.
2. Copy jabber_notifier_plugin folder to builder_plugins/installed
3. Modify builds/your_project/cruise_config.rb by adding the following lines
   (change subscriber ids and sender account details to appropriate) :
   

Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.jabber_notifier.subscribers = [
    "subscriber1@jabber.org",
    "subscriber2@jabber.org",
    "subscriber2@jabber.org"
  ]
  project.jabber_notifier.account = 'sender@jabber.org'
  project.jabber_notifier.password = 'sender_password'
  ...
end

4. Start the builder (./cruise build your_project)
