In Standup, talk about
----------------------
* plan IPM
* look at cruise.onemanswalk.com
* plan UI meeting w/ at least josh, darci, me, and alex - chad & jason yip
  * which fonts are which? psd?
  * more or less content in dashboard? and headers?
  * colored rows for passing / failing?
  * which format for previous builds?
  * is there a way to make the logo stay at the bottom AND scroll if it needs to?
  * what about version # and rails?
* how do we force a build?
  * restful interface?
* license story - I added rolf to it
* my stuff
  * working on ui
  * public cc instance
    * need to work through darwin ports
* let's put a contributor list up on the wiki
* when you're done w/ a story, mark it done on the wiki, and put it in the changelog w/ your name(s)  

UI Stuff
--------
* sorting for > 5 projects
* last build time END in label
* last build ended ('5 minutes ago', '3 hours ago', etc)
  * more concise date / time - follow gmail
* project w/ edit link in dashboard
* tests summary should only be there if we found tests
  * 5 / 5 tests passed
  * 4 / 7 tests passed
  * no tests run
* collapsable sections - make sure interesting sections are expanded by default
* include historical read-only project settings on build page
* color of builds - needs more indicators (icons)
* show build progress bar or something - "build 78 in progress, started 5 minutes ago"
  * on project page & dashboard


* icons?

* story : archive builds based on # of builds / date

Bugs
----

Necessary
---------
* test application_helper
* how do the builders get started?  the webapp will need to be able to start / restart / stop them eventually,
  can we do this now?  how?  can we do it in a way that works on windows / mac / *nix?
* builder
  * should reload project everytime it wakes up (so as to pick up changes from the webapp)
  * should reload server settings every time it wakes up, too
  * should sleep for at least 30 secs by default
* should we just go from a rails gem?  why not?  if we're a gem ourselves...?
* create "Add Project" story - add a project from the web app, should be easy
* better reaction to exceptions in builder (see concerns)

Build
-----
* Configurable build command(s);
* Make the website a proper "semantic XHTML + CSS" job
* Configurable polling interval

Dev
---
* project.path setter after every call to Project.new is ugly. Move to the c'tor (? or not ?)
* Check what happens with parsing "svn log" output if a project has svn:externals, and there is a new revision in there
* RESTful URLs everywhere

Concerns
--------
? Look at handling of timezones when parsing/displaying revision time. Especially, SubversionLogParser.
  It may prove an interesting story (hopefully, not).

? Need VERY careful consideration about what to do with exceptions within the main build loop, 
  especially, all steps of Project#build_revision. Target audience here is the "build monkey" and the 
  design objective here is "easy troubleshooting".
    * this exception kills the builder :
        svn: Can't connect to host 'rubyforge.org': A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.

? Builder should do something about local changes in the checked out copy of the project. Options are: ignore them (worst), 
  write a warning, or overwrite these changes during 'svn update'
  
? What to do when we are building revision X, and there is already a directory from our previous attempt to 
  build that same revision?

  jss: delete it

? Parser doesn't handle gracefully a situation when local copy is ahead of the repository (perhaps, after 
  the repository was restored from a backup)
    C:/projects/lipid/builds/passing_project/work averkhov$ svn log -r HEAD:BASE
    svn: No such revision 7
    ./subversion_log_parser.rb:7:in `readline': end of file reached (EOFError)
            from ./subversion_log_parser.rb:7:in `parse'
            ...

? we need to present times very readable manner in the timezone of one's browser
  * 10:30 AM today, 1:30 PM yesterday, 3:00 AM 5 days ago, 5:30 PM May 3, 2006, etc

? builds have NUMBERS not LABELS - I think - jss

? Is 10 seconds a good default for polling interval? Methinks, it's not polite when dealing with rubyforge.org. Alex
