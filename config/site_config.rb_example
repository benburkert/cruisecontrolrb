# site_config.rb contains examples of various configuration options for the local installation
# of CruiseControl.rb.

# EMAIL NOTIFICATION
# ------------------

# CruiseControl.rb can notify you about build status via email. It uses ActionMailer component of Ruby on Rails 
# framework. Obviously, ActionMailer needs to know how to send out email messages. 
# If you have an SMTP server on your network, and it needs no authentication, write this in your site_config.rb:
# 
# ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
#   :address =>        "yoursmtpserver",
#   :domain =>         "yourdomain.com",
# }
#
# If you have no SMTP server at hand, you can configure email notification to use GMail SMTP server, as follows
# (of course, you'll need to create a GMail account):
#
# ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
#   :address =>        "smtp.gmail.com",
#   :port =>           587,
#   :domain =>         "yourdomain.com",
#   :authentication => :plain,
#   :user_name =>      "yourgmailaccount",
#   :password =>       "yourgmailpassword"
# }
# 
# The same approach works for other SMTP servers thet require authentication. Note that GMail's SMTP server runs on a 
# non-standard port 587 (standard port for SMTP is 25).
#
# For further details about configuring email notification, see Ruby On Rails documentation for ActionMailer::Base.

# If you don't want to allow anyone trigger build through dashboard, you can set as follow:
# $DISABLE_BUILD = true
# Notice: if you set above attribute, all projects on the dashboard are disable to trigger build.
