  - use revision to see if something has been changed
- 2

- 3
  - optimize external handling
  - only use 1 level 
  - optimize if in same repos

Questions

Bugs
----
If you create a symlink in installed -> a directory in available plugins, the documentation can't read the directory
under installed.

What should be the status of a build that passed, but THEN the build loop crashed? Answer: it's not a build status, but
a BUILDER status. Rolf suggested "Misbehaving". Add a story to the wiki.

CruiseControl.NET tray (projects.rxml) - what should we set for next build time?

Generalize things like build.changeset, build.output; make them write out error messages when the file doesn't exist,
or exists but is not readable

Contents of a project panel "build details" section on the dashboard can be prerendered by the builder (as Ruby,
or even directly as XHTML) and cached in the build artifacts directory (? but complexity cost may be too high ?)

Link to /builds/Project.four (project with a dot without builds) breaks, because of the way routes.rb parses the dot

To finish the RSS story:
   * RSS icon
   * Figure out why Firefox 1.5 goes nuts on Rolf's PC when you try to open a feed in it.

Committed_by and comments on the dashboard need to be limited to a certain number of characters.

Comments on the dashboard need tooltips to display the full message.

If the build takes say 7501 seconds, it displays 2 hours and 5 minutes and 1 second.
  - It might be better to display 2 hours, 5 minutes and 1 second.  Or perhaps drop the seconds?

Looks like we won't detect cruise_config modification if it happens during the build

Tech
----
Update all Rails-generated files to Rails 1.2.2 versions thereof

look for a way to generate URLs in email templates through Rails' routes

Necessary
---------
* test application_helper
* builder
  * should reload server settings every time it wakes up, too

Build
-----

Dev
---
* Check what happens with parsing "svn log" output if a project has svn:externals, and there is a new revision in there
* RESTful URLs everywhere

Concerns
--------
? Look at handling of timezones when parsing/displaying revision time. Especially, SubversionLogParser.
  It may prove an interesting story (hopefully, not).

? Parser doesn't handle gracefully a situation when local copy is ahead of the repository (perhaps, after
  the repository was restored from a backup)
    C:/projects/lipid/builds/passing_project/work averkhov$ svn log -r HEAD:BASE
    svn: No such revision 7
    ./subversion_log_parser.rb:7:in `readline': end of file reached (EOFError)
            from ./subversion_log_parser.rb:7:in `parse'
            ...
